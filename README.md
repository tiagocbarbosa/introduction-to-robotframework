**introduction-to-robotframework** is a project created for the workshop "*Conhecendo Robot Framework para automação de testes*" (Robot Framework for test automation) by [Aubay Portugal](https://www.aubay.pt/) which I was the speaker, and it contains files that present essential knowledge in Robot Framework, such as:
- Structure of a Robot file;
- Types of variables;
- Examples of test and keyword files;
- Locators for web testing;
- Web testing with Selenium Library;
- API testing with Requests Library.

The workshop was recorded and is available in Portuguese on YouTube via [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1Yp3Ju4C-U).
